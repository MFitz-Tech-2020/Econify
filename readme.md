# Econify Test Node Project
The database is Mongodb.
GraphQL-yoga is used to setup the GraphQL server.
And request-promise is used to call the Google Place API.
You can run the project using the following:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
Then the server will be on http://localhost:4000.
Go to http://localhost:4000 on the browser and then click the Docs and Schema to check GraphQL details.
